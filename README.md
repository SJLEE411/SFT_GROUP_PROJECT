# Seneca Deliveries Project - Group 4


Welcome to the Seneca Deliveries project repository for Group 4! In this project, we are working on a solution for a local delivery company that manages multiple trucks and routes for package delivery. The goal is to design and build a system that efficiently assigns packages to trucks based on their weight, size, and proximity to the destination.

## Project Description

The city map is represented as a 25 by 25 square grid, with buildings, routes, and delivery paths. Our delivery trucks have specific routes and capacities, and our task is to determine the best truck for each package based on the distance to the destination and available space. We'll also need to handle package diversion and delivery path calculations.

## Milestone 5 Progress (Current Status)
In Milestone 5, our group has made significant progress:

Implemented integration tests that ensure the correct interaction between different functions.
Created acceptance tests to validate that the requirements of the project are met.
Executed the acceptance tests and debugged any issues that arose.
Updated the function-integration-requirements-test matrix to reflect the status of each test.
Conducted a thorough review of the test matrix to ensure all tests have been performed and passed.
Prepared a final testing report that documents all tests, bug fixes, and the overall project outcome.

## Repository Structure
Our repository is organized as follows:
SourceCode: Contains the project's source code, including functions and algorithms.
TestDocuments: Contains the written test documents, including unit, integration, and acceptance tests.
TestResults: Contains recorded test results and logs from test executions.
Documentation: Includes project-related documents, diagrams, and references.
ScrumReports: Contains weekly scrum reports with updates on team progress and activities.
